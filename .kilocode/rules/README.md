## Rules System

The `.kilocode/rules/` directory contains custom rules that define agent behavior, permissions, and access controls. Rules are written in Markdown format and provide a way to customize how the coding agent interacts with the system.

### Rule Format
Each rule file follows this structure:
- **Title**: A descriptive name for the rule using a markdown H1 header
- **Description**: Clear explanation of what the rule does and why it exists
- **Scope/Details**: Specific information about when and where the rule applies, often organized in bullet points under appropriate headings

### Creating New Rules
Rules should be created as markdown files in the `.kilocode/rules/` directory. The format is flexible but should include:
1. A clear title explaining the rule's purpose
2. A detailed description of what the rule does
3. Scope information explaining when and where it applies
4. Any additional configuration details or considerations
