# Context File Rules

Context files must:
- Contain factual, decision-oriented information
- Be reusable across assignments
- Prefer updating existing files over creating new ones

Avoid:
- TODOs
- Task-specific steps
- Implementation plans
- Temporary notes

Good context content:
- Architecture patterns
- Constraints and gotchas
- Naming conventions
- Decisions with rationale
- Verified behaviors
